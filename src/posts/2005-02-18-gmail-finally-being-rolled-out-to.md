As many could predict from the GMail invitation surplus of late, Gmail is
      finally opening up registration to just about anyone. Although the front page of <a
      href="http://gmail.com">gmail.com</a> doesn't mention it, the notification service
      sent an email to my old account today. I've been using GMail for months, but originally I
      signed up on their website so I could hear when they would allow me to register. That email
      finally came direct from google today, to invite me to use gmail.
