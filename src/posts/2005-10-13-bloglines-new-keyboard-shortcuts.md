As a follow up to Google Reader (and possibly pressured by them), Bloglines
      has added <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/about/news#90">Keyboard Shortcuts</a>!
      <br />
      <br />This is nicely done, and it is the one feature from Google Reader that I had
      really wanted. I really like the j/k/s navigation. One little nitpick though is to allow j or
      s to start the browsing, so I don't have to click on a link to start the browsing.
