As I mentioned <a
      href="http://uncommentedbytes.blogspot.com/2004/06/giving-eclipse-chance.html">previously</a>,
      I <em>was</em> having trouble with the 3.0 release of Eclipse. I thought it was
      time for an update, as my opinion has improved dramatically.
      <br />
      <br />As a quick background, I have been using Eclipse since early 2003 when I fell in
      love with it. Eclipse made my life so much easier. I had been longing for an IDE that could
      refactor, even though I didn't know what to call it. I couldn't understand why imports
      couldn't be automatic, and compiling couldn't be simpler. Code completion was nice, but I
      wanted more, and Eclipse delivered.
      <br />
      <br />3.0 was causing me grief in the speed department. However after using it for about
      a week of actual work I'm not seeing the speed hit anymore on my Windows 2K machine***. I'm
      loving the Ant integration that finally works for me. Until now I always used Ant externally
      as the embedded version failed. I did have to point to a 1.5.4 version of Ant since 1.6.x
      seems to cause problems with a few Weblogic specific tasks (that are poorly written, I might
      add). I'm getting used to code folding, a feature I didn't think I would use. The "add/remove
      block comment" option is nice. And JUnit testing seems smoother for some reason. Add with the
      CVS enhancements and color scheme improvements, and I'm a happy camper!
      <br />
      <br />*** - I do see occasionally a long pause after not using Eclipse for many minutes.
      Maybe someone has seen a bug report on this?
