Blaine tells us <a
      href="http://www.blainekendall.com/index.php/archives/2005/01/20/dont-use-null-or-1-in-your-unwritten-methods/">Donâ€™t
      use null or -1 in your unwritten methods</a>, and I have to agree. He's pointing to Tim
      Bray's <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/18/TestingOrder">error in
      unit testing</a>.
      <br />
      <br />I have to say this is a great idea, and should be used by everyone. That is,
      instead of returning null or -1 for an unimplemented method, you should throw a
      RuntimeException ("Method has not been implemented"). Even better would be to create your own
      UnimplementedMethodException and throw that.
      <br />
      <br />Good stuff to read for breakfast!
