I'm a little disappointed that no real straight answers came from my last
      entry: <a
      href="http://uncommentedbytes.blogspot.com/2004/07/jess-architecture-in-j2ee-environment.html">Uncommented
      Bytes: Jess Architecture in a J2EE Environment</a>
      <br />
      <br />So now I'm lead to believe that Jess may truly be difficult to integrate into our
      highly scalable, distributed, enterprise architecture. Wrapping Jess in a custom RMI server
      doesn't seem very elegant to me, but as of now it looks like the only solution. As I mentioned
      in the comments of my other post, if Jess is the reference implementation for JSR 94, wouldn't
      they come up with a better way to integrate into a J2EE environment?
