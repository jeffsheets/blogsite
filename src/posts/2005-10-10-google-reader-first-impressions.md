Here's my thoughts (pros/cons) on the new <a
      href="http://www.google.com/reader/lens/">Google Reader</a>, as I use my past few
      years with Bloglines as comparison.
      <br />
      <br />First, I love the clean Web 2.0 look! This is a big improvement of the frames of
      Bloglines. It was easy to export my feeds from Bloglines and import them into Google Reader,
      although Google seemed to hang on the import. I just returned later to find all of my feeds
      running. I love the keyboard navigation (using j/k to go down/up the list).
      <br />
      <br />But there are reasons that I'm sticking with Bloglines. Bloglines makes it easier
      for me to see all of my feeds at once by clicking on the "N updated feeds" link. They also
      make it easier for me to mark all of my feeds as read this way. In Google it seems I have to
      scroll using j/k through each link, but in Bloglines I can pull them up and skim through the
      list. I really prefer seeing them all at once and skimming.
      <br />
      <br />So Bloglines for now, and I hope that Bloglines picks up on some of Googles
      Ajax-ian tricks...
