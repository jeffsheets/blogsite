Finally fed up with jRoller, I have now migrated all of my blogs to
      Blogger. I just couldn't take the downtime any longer. And how could I pass up the new
      templates and comments on Blogger?!?!

      <br />My old blog is <a href="http://jroller.com/page/jsheets">here</a> if
      you're interested in seeing it. No looking back now.
