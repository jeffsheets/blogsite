Been exploring 3d Printing for the [past](https://hachyderm.io/@jeffsheets/111370879210190495) [few](https://hachyderm.io/@jeffsheets/111479919031787304) [months](https://hachyderm.io/@jeffsheets/111412202543983277), and have graduated to the point of creating my own [remixed](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6425634) [designs](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6425686). Finally time to share details of going from no-knowledge to amateur-level-knowledge in a few short weeks!

## Getting Started

The journey began when my teen son wanted to 3d print a [costume](https://www.printables.com/en/model/394975-spring-bonnie-suit-fnaf/files). The costume was for halloween, but really for the opening of the Five Nights at Freddy's [movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Nights_at_Freddy%27s_(film)) - a day he'd been looking forward to for years as a fan of the game. The [local library](https://www.papillion.org/927/3D-Printer) and also our [Do Space](https://dospace.org) digital lab^[[Do Space](https://dospace.org) is so cool! Free digital labs, 3d printers, laser cutters, podcast studio, etc... Omaha is awesome!] have free 3d printing time. So I thought sure, until we started realizing that each piece of the costume could take 8+ hours of print time each. So I kept putting off the project as October 31st rolled ever closer until one day discovering that Creality released their latest budget 3d printer the [Ender-3 v3 SE](https://www.creality.com/products/creality-ender-3-v3-se) and it was only ~$199 on Amazon.

We made the purchase, set it up, and had our first print going in maybe 30-45 minutes. Watching it self-level then figuring out how to slice an STL file and transfer it to the machine was the quick minimal learning curve. It really was plug-n-play!

I found and installed the community developed [Markdown Navigator Enhanced plug-in](https://github.com/vsch/idea-multimarkdown)

{% imagePlaceholder "./src/assets/images/posts/intellij-pasting/intellij-markdown-navigator-enhanced.png", "IntelliJ Markdown Navigator enhanced plugin options" %}

It has a ton more options for editing, parsing, and styling Markdown files.

A few settings I found helpful:
- **Soft wrap enabled** - to allow for composing content to flow without worrying about entering newlines to view. I also updated the margin to 120 in the Editor > Code Style section
- **Jekyll front matter** - enable this extension in the parser section so the front matter is styled as yml
- **Parser profile** - the "Custom" default seems to match closely to 11ty usage of [markdown-it](https://markdown-it.github.io/markdown-it/) as a mostly CommonMark w/ a few Github flavors added in. i'll continue to tweak this over time
- **Chromium Embdedded** - preview browser instead of the default java swing version

## Image Options

At first I was confused where the "pasting image" options were. To get them to show up, first I had to paste an image into the markdown text. Then the screen full of detailed options appeared:

{% imagePlaceholder "./src/assets/images/posts/intellij-pasting/intellij-markdown-image-options.png", "IntelliJ Markdown plugin image options" %}

This works great to store the image in the `/src/assets/images/posts/<postname>/` folder! And inserts a markdown image tag into the document.

For now I'll still have to replace the markdown with some custom liquid shortcode like: {% raw %} \
`{% imagePlaceholder "./src/assets/images/posts/intellij-pasting/intellij-markdown-image-options.png", "IntelliJ Markdown plugin image options" %}`
{% endraw %}

## Developer Experience

I'm much more comfortable editing in IntelliJ now vs VSCode. I know that is my own personal preference, but the beauty of hosting my own site is also being able to tailor the Developer Experience any way I want! The comfort level of building and producing my own product brings so much joy compared to the "locked-in service provider" feeling that I had for years previously.

Starting to really get that [personal site as a worry-stone](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/) feeling ðŸ¤—

Still need to take this one step further and have a markdown processor so the extra shortcode step isn't needed...
