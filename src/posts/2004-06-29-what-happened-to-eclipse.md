I've been using the latest 3.0 release of Eclipse for a full day now, and I
      have to cry out "What happened?". I've been using 2.1.x for many many months now, without so
      much as a hiccup. However 3.0 has been causing me problems all day. I love the new look, and I
      love many of the new features (Ant finally works for me!). But it's so slow, even on my beefed
      up dev box, and it has locked up repeatedly. I'm about a half day away from switching back to
      my *thankfully* backed up 2.1.3. Well, back to the trusty task manager to kill and restart my
      instance again... I should have just waited until the first or second maintenance release...
