Okay, so I almost made it a full year without a post. It was some well
      needed time away from blogging, but I want to try and get it back together on a weekly
      basis.<br /><br />So what's going on? I took a new job at Lockheed Martin, working
      on some very interesting high profile contracts. It is very enjoyable and rewarding work so
      far. Actually, my lack of blogging coincides with my start date at LM last fall. Unfortunately
      (or not) I can't post to here from work.<br /><br />Still doing Java. Still
      traveling often. I want to post some about Guice and Spring soon. I hope to fill in about
      Weblogic 10. Maybe some old school Struts. And I hope to sprinkle in an <a
      href="http://ojug.org/">OJUG</a> review or two.<br /><br />So here's to a
      reload of this thing.
