This <a
      href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,65165,00.html">article </a> on
      Wired describes a new website called <a href="http://www.mirrordot.com/">Mirrordot
      </a> that will automatically mirror any site posted on slashdot. A very cool idea
      indeed!
      <br />
      <br />As it states in the article, though, I wonder how this will affect the ad revenue
      of some of the slashdotted sites. On one hand, they won't receive revenue from mirrordot, on
      the other hand mirrordot will keep their site alive!
