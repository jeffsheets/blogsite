Wow, it is great to here that <a
      href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/6175">Version 7.1 of the TiVo service update
      installs and enables a web server</a>!
      <br />
      <br />Now I just have more pressure on myself ot get that wireless adapter for my Tivo.
      Apparently you can download video straight from the box, without having to use Tivo Desktop
      software. Sweet.
