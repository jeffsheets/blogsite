I want to write more. I enjoy it. I like to think I'm sometimes not bad at it. And to be honest, I literally think about blogging something multiple times a day. I fondly remember the before-times when short sweet blog posts were fun and interactive and responsive to other posts. But my brain gets in the way and says things like:
- why would you write when you should be doing XYZ chore instead?
- what authority do you have to talk about this?
- you should add a ton of details, and quotes, and links, and pretty pictures, and that will take forever so why not doom scroll instead?
- what's one more day without blogging?
- ugh - but what if you made your own blog dev experience much better then you'd blog more so just wait until that day that will never come

And then I read something simply great like [Think less, ship more](https://cassidoo.co/post/think-less/)
> I need to learn to (over)think less. Every time I “just write” or “just record” or “just post” or “just deploy” I end up coming up with more genuine content that people like more, and that I enjoy making more. -- [Cassidy Williams](https://cassidoo.co/)

So true. Like I always tell my clients (or my kids) when they ask if their project is ready for primetime or not: YES - just ship it! Iterate. Shipping more will get you to refine the process.

And yeah, this will probably fall off -- as you can see from my post trend over the years (wait 20+ years now???)

But man, I've got 5-10 blog ideas and drafts ready to go -- so nows the time to Just ~~Ship~~ Publish It! <imagine a swoosh tagged just-do-it logo right here LOL>
