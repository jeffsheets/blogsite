So.... It's been more than a month since my last post? I really can't
      believe it, which is why I'm writing this now!!!<br /><br />The main thing
      happening in my last few months is my change of employer from <a
      href="http://www.raytheon.com/">Raytheon</a> to <a
      href="http://www.west.com/">West Corp</a>. Still in Omaha, and still doing J2EE, but
      I received a large promotion so I can detail more in design and decisions than merely
      implementation. Don't get me wrong, I'm still writing code most of my day. I'd go crazy if I
      didn't...<br /><br />This means I'm not heavily invested in the Jetspeed portal
      engine, which is a bit sad considering I've been working with it as it has grown to maturity.
      I'm now mostly engrained with Weblogic, and experimenting with every "latest buzzword
      technology" that floats by.<br /><br />Having done AJAX work, long before it was
      called AJAX, I'm happy to explore more code in that direction. Along with my attempts to push
      for more JMS, Spring, unit testing, agile approaches, and anything else to make life easier at
      my new position.<br /><br />On a personal note, our daughter, Madison, turned 1 in
      the past couple of weeks. What an amazing experience the first year has been for Shayla and I!
      Our family really is the greatest blessing in my life...<br /><br />Oh, and I
      can't forget, <a href="http://www.huskers.com/">Go Huskers</a>! Our baseball team
      just won their first game EVER in the <a href="http://www.cwsomaha.com/">College World
      Series</a> here in Omaha!!!
