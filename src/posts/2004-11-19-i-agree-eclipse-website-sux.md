I have to completely agree with Anthony, that the <a
      href="http://aperritano.blogspot.com/2004/11/eclipse-website-sux.html">Eclipse website
      SUX</a>! Make 90% of your use cases simple, and this means put the Eclipse IDE download
      and help screens on your front page! Realize what your breadwinner is and sell it, don't bury
      it to make it appear on the same level as your other not-so-popular projects! As a first time
      visitor, weeding through the the projects is mind-boggling and confusing to say the least.
      <br />
      <br />I have spent a lot of time looking for things on their site myself, and more time
      helping others that I am teaching Eclipse to. The website makes it hard for me to say "Just go
      to <a href="http://eclipse.org/">eclipse.org</a> and download it". Especially when
      you hit the page and all you see is bureaucratic nonsense about the organization. There is a
      place for this, but not on the front page!
      <br />
      <br />I am not claiming to be a good web designer, but I do claim to recognize good
      designs, and my site doesn't host one of the most popular Java projects in existence!
