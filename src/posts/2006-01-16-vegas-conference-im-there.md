I've just registered for <a
      href="http://javasymposium.techtarget.com/">TheServerSide.com Symposium</a> at <a
      href="http://www.caesars.com/Caesars/LasVegas">Caesar's Palace</a> in Las Vegas! I
      wish I could say that every month :-)<br /><br />The <a
      href="http://www.accessvegas.com/faqs/las-vegas-weather.htm">weather</a> near the end
      of march should be near perfect, even if I'll spend 80% of my time indoors...<br
      />March: 68 F / 43 F<br />April: 77 F / 50 F<br /><br />Compared to my
      usual <a href="http://www.cityrating.com/cityweather.asp?city=Omaha">Omaha</a>,
      this will be awesome (with the low in Vegas > the high in Omaha)!<br />March
      38.6<br />April 51.9<br /><br />Better than the weather should be the
      speakers. Here's what my agenda looks to be for the speakers that I am signed up for: Cedric
      Beust, Craig McClanahan, Cameron Purdy, Justin Gehtland, Dion Almaer, Rod Johnson or Kito
      Mann, Gavin King, Scott Ambler, Jonas Boner, Ted Neward, Bruce Snyder, and Bruce Tate (not to
      mention possible others!). I'm stoked to listen to these guys. My only question is Where's
