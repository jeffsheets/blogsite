A couple of updates from my <a
      href="http://uncommentedbytes.blogspot.com/2004/07/which-portal-apache-jetspeed-of-course.html">Commentary
      on Jetspeed</a>.
      <br />
      <br />First, I was thrilled to see Benjamin of the eXo team respond to my remarks, and
      also receive great feedback from Stéphane regarding Jahia. Second, my eyes bugged out
      reviewing my hit counts at <a href="http://stats.blogger.com/index.jsp">bstats</a>
      (for Blogger users) and seeing that I had been on the front page of <a
      href="http://theserverside.com/news/thread.tss?thread_id=27044">TheServerSide.com</a>
      (sincere thanks to Dion)!
      <br />
      <br />Benjamin mentioned in my comments here, on <a
      href="http://jroller.com/page/portlets/20040701#which_open_source_portal_server">Punit's
      blog</a>, and at TheServerSide, that Punit valued JSR 168 highly in his list. My list
      was merely my opinion, and in no way a challenge to Punit. I was simply trying to add another
      person's input into the community. I hope that it didn't seem that I was attacking his list,
      because I was trying to just share my thoughts. This is why at the end of my post I pointed
      out: <blockquote>I should do another entry on JSR 168 and why that is not important to
      us, yet. Jetspeed essentially shelters us from the current hype.</blockquote> And I
      still intend to do this. In a nutshell, Jetspeed allows us to write actions and jsp's using
      their built-in MVC Portlet and thus not have to write portlets of our own (thus making JSR 168
      negligible). Using Jetspeed as an "Application Portal" and not as an "Enterprise Portal"
      allows leverage for us that others are unable to achieve.
      <br />
      <br />And Stéphane, I believe from my testing that Jahia is a great product, however
      Jetspeed 1 is all that we needed. I too look forward to using Jetspeed 2 when it is released!
      <br />
      <br />So my list stands with Jetspeed in the lead. It will take a great portal to knock
      it from my list, and as such I hope to evaluate eXo, Jahia, and the others, again in the
      future. However at this time it is still true that Jetspeed 1.x is the only open source portal
      that I will trust in our production environment.
