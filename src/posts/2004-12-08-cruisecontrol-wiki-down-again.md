Is it just me, or is the CruiseControl <a
      href="http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CC/OutOfMemoryError">Wiki</a>
      down an awful lot? Many times it has seemed very slow or out of commission over the past month
      that I have really been using it. It's rather frustrating that the main source of
      documentation is often inaccessible! I still love the product, but just wish the wiki would be
      more stable and reliable.
