After 18 months of owning and driving an electric vehicle (EV), and collecting notes after notes after notes,
it is finally time to share some thoughts/tips/tricks.

**TL&DR;** Owning an EV is AMAZING and really feels like the future in just about every way possible

For this post, I'm trying to keep thoughts generic across the concept of EVs, without anything too specific about
the specific model of car that I'm owning and driving. I think these thoughts are valuable in having a discussion
about migrating away from fossil-fuel powered vehicles and towards electric, without any baggage of particular
brands/owners/companies to get in the way.

## Awesomeness ‚ö°Ô∏è
- **Charging at home**Ô∏è  
The #1 top thing -- daily - no longer consciously thinking "do i have enough gas?". No longer running late and having
to find a gas station on your way. No more freezing cold and pumping gas! Cannot emphasize this enough! There's so much 
talk about charging stations and such, but it just mostly doesn't matter when you charge at home.
- **Cheaper fuel**  
At least in Omaha, our OPPD power is roughly 1/4 or less the price of gas - on a $/mile basis. I think EV marketing
is really missing out by not emphasizing the $/mile advantages of electric over gas.
- **Starting car in closed garage**  
Pre-condition your car inside your garage without worrying about opening the garage. Can't do this with a gas car!
It is so handy and it feels like the future. In Omaha the temp outside is either way too HOT or too COLD most of the year.
- **Regenerative "braking"**  
Instead of coasting, your car will regenerate the battery when it slows down. Great for 2 reasons! 1) when city driving,
all those slowdowns and stops actually help keep more energy in your battery. 2) It SAVES your brakes! Seriously,
you end up using your brakes so much less, basically only for fast/hard stops. Usually never even have to touch your brakes.
- **No oil changes‚ÄºÔ∏è**  
Almost no maintenance, really. Tires and wiper fluid. Brakes should last a lot longer because of regen. No oil, no belts,
no transmission fluid, etc...
- **So quiet**  
You quickly get used to hearing how loud other vehicles are
- **Instant torque**  
Pretty fun to be so quick. No engine to rev up, so your car just goes when you need it to!

## Charger Must-know Tips üîå
- **Optimal Charging level 50% for peak battery life**  
Depends. Some batteries want to be 100%. Many EV batteries are happier at 50%. It took a little getting used to it for
me to top-up at 75% daily. I only go to 100% before road trips. This will save my battery capacity over the years.
- **Home Overnight Charging**  
Home charging is not fast. It'll mostly take you overnight to fully charge. But that is okay! I normally get down to around
35-40% and then every morning I'm back to 75% when I wake up. I have ZERO range anxiety on a daily basis. I can easily go
150+ miles without thinking about it daily, but I'm usually more like 20-30 miles.
- **Off-peak charging**  
In Omaha our electric is same price all day, but many places it is cheaper at night. So setting your car to charge overnight
can be cheaper. But I set mine to charge before 7:30AM because the car also warms to charge and this saves energy by
warming when I also want to pre-condition the inside.
- **Scheduled departure charging**  
Just super handy to have a warm/cool car when you want it daily. Mine can do this depending on GPS location which is a plus too.

## Road Trips üåÑ
I drive 2-3 hours away every couple of months. Omaha to Des Moines, or KC. Have also gone farther to Minneapolis. 
- **Superchargers (DC Fast Charging)**  
These are the best. You can top up from 25%-85% in roughly 18-22 minutes for ~$15 in my experience. Often times these stations
are near convenience stores, grocery stores, or even at gas stations. So in roughly the time it takes to stretch your
legs and get some snacks you'll be ready to get back on the road.
- **Level 2 Chargers**  
This is basically like home charging. Wonderful if your hotel has one! Perfect for overnight charges! City governments like
to put these in random places like shopping areas. But it takes 6-8 hours to get a decent charge so more useful at hotels.
- **Charging Speed**  
The lower your charge, the faster it is. So from 5%-60% is pretty fast. From 60-90% is a little slower. From 90%-100% takes
quite a while. So ideally you'll drive until you get around 15-20% then top up, as you can add more charge faster. I still
struggle with this as I get nervous below 20-25% but it's all mental.
- **Road trips take a little planning**  
Interstate driving is pretty easy. But going off interstate takes a bit of planning. There are still areas I won't take
my EV (like Okoboji or Branson) where the route is off-interstate and there are fewer (if any) fast chargers. Planning
ahead to make sure you have enough charge to get there, and then to get to a charger or return home, takes time.
- **ABRP and PlugShare**  
The [A Better Route Planner](https://abetterrouteplanner.com) and [PlugShare](https://www.plugshare.com) sites are the go-to
for planning your trips and finding chargers.
- **Pre-warm battery for charging**  
Tell your car in advance that you'll be charging soon, so it'll get your battery warmed and ready to charge as fast as possible.
- **Charging to connected credit card**  
Super convenient to just plug-in and have the app already know your credit card. Set it up ahead of time.
- **Need for hotel level 2 chargers**  
Glad to hear [Hilton is adding more](https://stories.hilton.com/releases/hilton-to-install-up-to-20000-tesla-universal-wall-connectors-at-2000-hotels).
This will only get better.

## Home Charger Thoughts üîã
- **240 Outlet is good enough**  
A 50-amp outlet can charge about 30 miles/per hour to my battery, which is plenty. If I hardwired a charger box, it could
be about 37-44 miles/hour of charge. But that box costs ~$400-500. For me it just isn't worth it. So I have a simple 
[NEMA 6-50 outlet](https://a.co/d/5U4iUOH) in my garage. A 14-50 (RV outlet) would also work fine.
- **Finding an electrician**  
This was difficult for me. A few that advertise as EV Electrician Installers had prices around double what I expected.
I found some HotTub/Spa installers that were better priced, and they routinely put in 240 outlets. I had to do a lot
of research on my own to understand what was needed though. I probably could have done it myself but I was too nervous
running that high of a charge on my own.
- **Use High Quality Outlet**  
My electrician put in a cheap Lutron outlet. It worked fine for a year and then my car started complaining about the
charger being too hot. I then found that everyone recommends a Hubbell outlet. So save yourself a ton of time and
install a Hubbell brand from the get go. They aren't that much more and you'll need it.
- **Tax write-off**  
The cost is partially covered by an IRS tax write-off, which was really nice

## Random Stuff üí°
- It‚Äôs heavy- EV's weigh a bunch more. You mostly won't notice but it does help in the snow.
- Uses special tires - Because of the weight, EV's need slightly special tires. Some also have padding to help with road noise, or so I hear.
- Frunk space - kinda cool to have extra storage in the front!
- Regen braking and coasting - it does take a week or two of driving to get used to this
- Regen low when cold - Cold weather affects the battery. The regen won't work as well. Also you'll have less overall range.

## Last Thoughts üéâ
- **Lots of talk about range, but little about efficiency between cars Wh/mi**  
If you're shopping for an EV, compare how efficient your car is to the other EVs. There are wild differences and the costs
will add up in the long term
- **Price is cheaper than you think!**
Seriously, all cars are expensive now. The average car costs way more than you'd think! EVs are often cheaper than
an average new car ([yes, even Teslas](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-model-3-model-y-less-than-average-gas-car-2023-10)!)
so if you're looking for a new car anyway definitely look for an EV.
- **Federal and Local Incentives**  
The Federal and Local incentives are pretty good and don't forget to look into them
