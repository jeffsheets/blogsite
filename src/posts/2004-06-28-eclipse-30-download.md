Okay, now that I'm all excited about Eclipse 3.0, and I just can't wait to
      check it out, I can't get a download speed over 12 KB/s. That's after trying most of the
      mirrors from our office in Omaha, which normally has blazing connection speeds. I'm not
      complaining, I'm just anxious to try it out. Especially since I'm giving a brownbag
      presentation over Eclipse to my fellow workers in less than 2 weeks.
      <br />
      <br />Oh, and the corporate powers have blocked all ports except 80 and mail, leaving
      bittorrent out of the question... I'll just keep patiently waiting...
