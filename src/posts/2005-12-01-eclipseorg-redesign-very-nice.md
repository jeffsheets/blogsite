After <a
      href="http://uncommentedbytes.blogspot.com/2004/11/i-agree-eclipse-website-sux.html">complaining
      in the past</a> about the Eclipse website, I'm really impressed with their <a
      href="http://www.eclipse.org/">site redesign</a>. I especially like how easy it is to
      download the Eclipse SDK now from their new <a
      href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">downloads area</a>! Finally, a person
      unfamiliar with the umbrella Eclipse organization can simply download the Eclipse SDK IDE
      without stumbling through the maze of projects.<br /><br />Nicely done! It's much
      more elegant and far lower on the confusing scale.
