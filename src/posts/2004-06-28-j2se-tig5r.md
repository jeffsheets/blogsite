As reported by <a
      href="http://www.davidflanagan.com/blog/000037.html">David Flanagan</a> and all over
      the blogosphere, the latest J2SE has been renamed from 1.5 "Tiger" to just 5.0. Maybe next
      year I can get my <a href="http://raytheon.com">company</a> to send me to JavaONE?
      Yeah right...
