Where was I when this Roller announcement was made? <a
      href="http://rollerweblogger.org/page/roller/20040707">Roller Now Simpler to
      Setup</a>
      <br />
      <br />After finding out today that there is a version of Roller with an embedded HSQLDB
      database, I went and set it up right away. I did a couple of tricks with it, because I already
      have a Tomcat server running on port 8080. But after a couple of small script changes, I was
      up and running in less than 20 minutes total!
      <br />
      <br />I had decided against Roller previously because I didn't want to mess with a
      separate database just to try it out. This makes things much easier for people to go and give
      it a whirl.
