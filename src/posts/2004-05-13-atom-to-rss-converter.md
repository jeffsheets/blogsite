I noticed this morning that java.blogs was not picking up my entries.
      Naturally I assumed it was caused by my switch from jRoller to Blogger yesterday. I checked my
      configuration and it dawned on me that Blogger uses Atom while java.blogs is looking for RSS.
      If the differences are new to you, then do a quick google to find numerous information on the
      political differences.

      <br />Anyway, to fix my problem I needed an Atom to RSS converter. Google to my rescue
      again! I found this little gem, that takes your Atom.xml and spits out valid RSS. I'm not back
      on java.blogs. Try it for yourself:
      <br />
      <br /><a href="http://uncommentedbytes.blogspot.com/atom.xml">atom</a>
      <br /><a
      href="http://www.2rss.com/atom2rss.php?atom=http://uncommentedbytes.blogspot.com/atom.xml">
      <br />atom as rss</a>
      <br />
      <br />Thanks for <a href="http://www.2rss.com/">2rss.com</a> for their
      services!
