I used to be happy with Yahoo! Mail, but they have taken away my favorite
      feature. A few weeks ago when they "upgraded" the interface to compete with GMail, they
      dropped the "include HTML tags" option when sending an email. It used to be nice that I could
      write HTML into my email so that my family could see nice pictures without ever needing to
      attach huge files. I just used a simple img tag that pointed to my website.
      <br />
      <br />So today I'm just frustrated. I've tried multiple different ways, even coding my
      entire email as HTML, but Yahoo! will not send it as HTML. Does anyone know if GMail will fix
      my problem? Can I send HTML emails using GMail? I would love to try it out when its available,
      and I really hope it fixes my problem. Until then, jasheets1 at good ole yahoo dot com will
      have to suffice as an email address.
