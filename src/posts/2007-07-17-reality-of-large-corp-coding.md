I really enjoyed the article &quot;Corporate Web Standards&quot;
      today, not only for the primary thoughts, but also the secondary discussion of corporate
      smells. [<a
      href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/corporate_web_standards/">http://www.digital-web.com/articles/corporate_web_standards/</a>]
      (thanks for the link from Elsewhere on the Net [<a
      href="http://www.quirksmode.org/elsewhere/archives/2007/07/index.html#entry1348">http://www.quirksmode.org/elsewhere/archives/2007/07/index.html#entry1348</a>])<p>The
      author describes a journey to implement web standards, but expresses some large corporation
      insight along the way. From youthful exuberance:<br>&quot;Initial stages of the
      project began and soon enough chunks of the project would be completed, neatly packaged, and
      passed off to the next stage of design or development. It was a finely tuned assembly
      line&mdash;we weren&#39;t cutting any corners, and were planning each step logically
      and carefully during those initial phases.<p>The code being produced was clean and
      semantic.&quot;<p>to experienced anxiety:<br>&quot;After a few weeks, the
      pressure began to build in our isolated building. As the launch date of our initial website
      approached, scope creep became a big problem. Stakeholders who signed off on designs
      beforehand would start to see final, assembled products and make fundamental architectural
      changes, as they had not fully understood the signed-off documents they had approved only
      weeks earlier.&quot;<br>&quot;The code became an angry, growing
      beast.&quot;<p>Not only can I relate to these statements, from 9 years at multiple
      large corporations, but I fully appreciate his attempt to bring everyone together; to get
      everyone on the same team.<br>&quot;We all like to comment our code in different
      ways, use different CSS layouts, and apply different naming conventions to our classes and
      IDs, but this won&#39;t work if you want to work within large project teams and develop to
      a company-wide set of standards.<p>It can actually be quite a difficult step for many
      developers to swallow their pride and give up personal coding conventions, and instead agree
      on standards that work better for the group as a whole.&quot;<p>I could go on and on
      about the high quality of this article, but in the end just read it for yourself. I really
      can&#39;t do it justice, as the author did a terrific job at expressing the necessary but
      difficult task of creating and utilizing large project corporate web standards.
