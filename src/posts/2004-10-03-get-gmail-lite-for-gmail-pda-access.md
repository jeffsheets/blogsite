I was frustrated with gmail for lacking a pure html version that can be
      used by PDA browsers. It was one of my complaints with gmail (along with not allowing html
      tags when composing). After some searching, I found <a
      href="http://gmail-lite.sourceforge.net/#gmail-lite">gmail-lite</a>! This is a php
      module that acts as a pure html proxy to gmail, meaning I can run it on my internal web server
      and check gmail from our pda at home! I still wish google supported this natively, but
      gmail-lite seems to do the job well enough for me...
