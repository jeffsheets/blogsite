While I don't really like the title (Middle America? come on, we're the
      Heartland or something, but not Middle America!), we're finally <a
      href="http://www.ifoapplestore.com/2006/03/01/apple-store-comes-to-middle-america/">getting
      an Apple Store</a>!<br /><br />Although I wish it was <a
      href="http://www.oldmarket.com/">downtown</a> or <a
      href="http://www.westroadsmall.com/html/index4.asp">closer to midtown</a> instead of
      out in the <a href="http://www.villagepointeshopping.com/">suburban "lifestyle
      center"</a>, I'm more than thrilled that we're finally getting one! Good thing I have
      some tax refund left over :-)
