A post on <a href="http://adamconnor.org/">Marginalia</a>
      describes his position on <a href="http://adamconnor.org/?p=45">Why I Hate
      PayPal</a>.<br /><br />My position is much simpler. Paypal has a large
      inbound phone center here in Omaha, and their local 402 area code phone number is one off from
      my work number. So I answer around 5 calls a week from people complaining about their Paypal
      account. I even had someone leave their credit card number on my voicemail once.<br
      /><br />So that's my reason to hate Paypal.<br /><br />(Please notice: I
      actually love their service, so this is just me venting about an annoyance, and it really has
      nothing to do with Paypal directly.)
