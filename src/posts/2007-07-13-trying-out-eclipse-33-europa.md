I took the plunge this week of moving from Eclipse 3.2.1 to Eclipse 3.3
      Europa. Technically, I went from the previous WTP release to the latest one. This WTP bundles
      some J2EE and DB features with the standard Eclipse. I don&#39;t really use it, but others
      on my team do.<p>I think this is the first time I have migrated from a prior Eclipse
      version successfully with 0 problems. I launched the old 3.2.1 one last time to Export my
      Preferences. Next I backed up my old eclipse dir to eclipse-old, and extracted the new version
      of Eclipse. Then I launched the new Europa. I was a little scared about importing the 3.2.1
      preferences, but it worked and I haven&#39;t seen any problems so far.<p>A couple of
      cool things. I was intrigued by the new ability to auto Format code on saves. Unfortunately,
      my current team has crazy coding standards that differ depending on the type of file (namely
      constant files, and SQL files).<p>I was happy to see that the ctrl-shift-r (Resources)
      screen has been updated. It now allows easier selection of files with the same name but in
      different projects. Previously it would just show build.xml and have a separate tab window to
      select from which project. Now it just lists all of the build.xml files but with the project
      name next to them for a single select box.<p>What&#39;s bad? I don&#39;t really
      know for sure yet. One thing is that the WTP bundle doesn&#39;t include Weblogic
      integration yet, though a few blogs mention that it is coming soon. It might already be out
      since I haven&#39;t checked since last Friday. This doesn&#39;t really affect me, but
      others on my team are waiting for the patch.<p>So I like it. It looks a little cleaner,
      and I like the few differences I have seen, and overall it works just like before. Nice work
      Europa team!
