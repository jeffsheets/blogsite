After setting up Mountain Lion on my Mac, I went and tried the new Notes
      sync feature. I've been syncing my notes from my iphone to Gmail for months now (or so I had
      thought).<div>
      <br /></div>
      <div>
      But going into the Notes app on my Mac I did not see anything newer than 6-8 months
      ago.</div>
      <div>
      <br /></div>
      <div>
      Then I checked gmail and the Notes label showed the same. And a few google searches turned up
      empty.</div>
      <div>
      <br /></div>
      <div>
      The fix for me was to go into iPhone settings &gt; Mail, Contacts, Calendars &gt;
      Fetch New Data &gt; Advanced &gt; and change my Gmail Notes account from Fetch to
      Manual.</div>
      <div>
      <br /></div>
      <div>
      Then I relaunched the Notes app on my phone and everything magically synced.</div>
      <div>
      <br /></div>
      <div>
      Scary thing is I think none of my Notes were backed up, even though I thought they were....
      Hopefully this will help someone else out there.</div>
