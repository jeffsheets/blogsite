<p>&nbsp;</p><p>This past weekend, I was able to
      attend and present at the 2015&nbsp;<a
      href="http://nebraskacode.com/">Nebraska.Code() Conference</a> in Lincoln, along with
      a few other Object Partners developers. With roughly 500 in attendance from presenters, to
      attendees, to sponsors, the conference had sessions and workshops covering everything from
      Mobile, Java, JavaScript, .NET, Ruby, Mobile, and much more. To get a feel for all of the
      varied sessions, check out the <a
      href="https://github.com/nebraskacode/2015-Slides-and-Demos">slide repo</a> or the
      <a href="http://nebraskacode.com/Schedule">conference schedule</a>. And to top it
      off, it was held in the beautiful new <a href="http://innovate.unl.edu/">Nebraska
      Innovation Campus</a> with a couple of after parties in Lincoln's amazing new <a
      href="http://www.canopyst.com/">Railyard Entertainment District</a>.</p>
      <p>For the TL;DR version of the recap see <a
      href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NebraskaCode?src=hash">#NebraskaCode</a> on
      Twitter. And of course, if you were following <a
      href="https://twitter.com/objectpartners">@ObjectPartners</a> you already know all of
      the details!</p>
      <p>The highlights of the conference for me, besides having our very own Object Partners
      <a href="https://twitter.com/jillian7789/status/578972855976611840">sponsor
      booth</a>:</p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Learning from devs from different ecosystems
      -</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"> Sitting at a table of developers from
      all different worlds like .NET, Mobile, Java, and JavaScript leads to many new conversations
      and ideas. The motivation gained by attending conferences is
      indispensable.</span></p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Functional Language meshing
      -</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"> It feels like the new hot languages in
      each ecosystem are leveraging very similar language constructs and functional paradigms. It's
      more than a little amazing that Groovy, TypeScript, F#, and Swift have evolved from different
      backgrounds into quite similar high-level ideas, philosphies, and even syntax. Probably a
      topic for another blog post.</span></p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Community Buzz -</strong><span
      style="font-size: 16px;"> The dev community in Omaha and Lincoln has such an exciting and
      welcoming feel to it right now. Just a good time to be a part of the environment here. So many
      talented people doing amazing things. This was shown well in a LocalOmaha session on growing
      the community from Sandi Barr and Matt Payne.</span></p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Workshops -</strong><span
      style="font-size: 16px;"> There were over 10 workshops to choose from on Thursday. I went
      to the well done "Cutting edge UI development with Flux, ReactJS, Browserify, Mocha, and Gulp"
      workshop led by our very own </span><a href="https://twitter.com/BruceCoddington"
      style="font-size: 16px;">Bruce Coddington</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">. I
      learned more about ReactJS in a couple of hours than I had previously learned reading many
      many blog posts. Combined with previous AngularJS/Grunt/Jasmine knowledge, I can now make
      sense of roughly a bazillion JavaScript buzzwords.</span></p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 16px;">Groovy sessions
      -&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://twitter.com/jshickey" style="font-size:
      16px;">Scott Hickey</a><span style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;from Object
      Partners led a couple of groovy talks. One that introduced people to Groovy that were new to
      the language. Another, smaller hands-on functional programming Groovy Kata session where the
      entire group learned new techniques and styles to functionally solve
      problems.</span></p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 16px;">TypeScript and WebComponents
      -</strong><span style="font-size: 16px;"> Both talks were great presentations from
      people with strong JavaScript and .NET backgrounds in Dave Fancher and Cory
      House.</span></p>
      <p><strong style="font-size: 16px;">The sessions I missed -</strong><span
      style="font-size: 16px;"> With so many talks going on at once, I missed more than a few
      that I wish I could have seen. From Docker, to Ruby, to Swift, to so many more (yes, even F#).
      One that stands out that I missed was the "Tranducers Explained" talk from Kevin Beaty. That's
      one that I'll have to revisit in the slides.</span></p>
      <p>Also a big thanks to everyone who attended my&nbsp;<a
      href="http://jeffsheets.github.io/BuzzworthyJava2015/#/" style="font-size: 16px;">JHipster
      and Spring Boot</a>&nbsp;session! I'm a huge fan of <a
      href="https://jhipster.github.io/">JHipster</a>&nbsp;so definitely check it out
      if you need to jumpstart an AngularJS + Java project that includes all of the client-side
      build tools too.</p>
      <p>Nebraska.Code() Conference 2015 was a success!&nbsp;Thank you to Ken Versaw and
      Adam Barney for organizing and throwing a great
      conference.</p><p><b>Cross-published on the Object Partners blog:&nbsp;
