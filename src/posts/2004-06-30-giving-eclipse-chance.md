Well I'm still not giving up on Eclipse. I'm going to try a tip that
      someone left me in the comments of my <a
      href="http://uncommentedbytes.blogspot.com/2004/06/what-happened-to-eclipse.html">last
      entry</a>. That is to basically delete the eclipse settings from my project (imported
      from 2.1) and create a new project in 3.0. It's worth a shot, especially considering all of
      the good comments that were left in favor of Eclipse. I really want everything to run smoothly
      since I have been the biggest promoter of Eclipse here at work. It has just been the greatest
      tool for me in the past. Wish me luck!
