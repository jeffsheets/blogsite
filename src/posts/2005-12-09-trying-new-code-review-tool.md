I've been wanting to better organize a structured code review on our
      project. So today I'm looking at the <a
      href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/Jupiter/">CSDL Jupiter Code Review Tool</a>.
      <br />
      <br />It looks promising, in that no external DB is required. It stores all review info
      in xml documents that are shared through our normal CVS project. It's an Eclipse plugin, which
      will make it easy to install and get our developers up to speed.
      <br />
      <br />And they have a nice <a
      href="http://csdl.ics.hawaii.edu/Tools/Jupiter/Core/doc/UsersGuide.html">user's
      guide</a>.
      <br />
      <br />I'm hoping it fulfills our needs, and I'll post the results of my review after a
      day or so of use. It should be a big improvement over the print / distribute / highlight
      review!
