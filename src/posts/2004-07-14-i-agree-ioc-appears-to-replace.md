Groboclown hits the nail on the head with his discussion about IoC.

      <br />This is precisely how I view IoC also! I'm just surprised to see someone else
      explain it in this way. I only wish I was allowed to use IoC in my environment, because each
      time I do a MyInterface object = new MyInterfaceImpl() I think that using IoC would be so much
      cleaner.
