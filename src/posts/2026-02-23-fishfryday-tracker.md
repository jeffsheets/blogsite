Just casually (and slightly embarrassingly) announcing the geekiest project page I've ever built: the [Omaha Fish Fry Tracker](/fishfry/) 🐟

Fish fries in Omaha are like [a big deal](https://sarahbakerhansen.com/omaha-fish-frys/), and amazingly fun and quirky and community at its best.

Like the best fish and chips, sometimes baked, fried shrimp, meat wheel raffles, pickle cards (not pull-tabs cause I'm not in Minnesota and in Nebraska we call them pickles), cover bands, and maybe (ok definitely) a beer or margarita or two. And long lines (like hanging out with friends hours long). And you go home smelling like a fryer. But man.... it's the best!

Somehow there's no good Omaha fish fry page to link to -- but [viewing the duckduckgo images](https://duckduckgo.com/?ia=images&t=h_&q=omaha+fish+fries&chip-select=search&iax=images) is a pretty great summary LOL

I don't know why I started keeping track, but I'm super happy I did :-)
